## Data Scientists LOVE Quarto

- Why?
- Many are tasked with creating outputs:
-- reports (html, pdf)
-- data dashboards
- Quarto's purpose is just that: publishing work for stakeholders

## Should you "switch" to Quarto?
- It depends
- For writing code in R or Python, it doesn't give you anything more (.Rmd, .R, .ipynb are fine)
- If you want students to create outputs (websites, reports, data dashboards), then yes


## More on Quarto
- For certain outputs (websites, data dashboards), knowing HTML/CSS is important
- Emphasis on "making things look nice" for stakeholders => command of HTML/CSS
- Presenters seemed to learn on their own. Should we include this in curriculum?
